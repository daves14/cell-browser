It's a simple cell-browser. It behaves similarly to the GWT CellBrowser widget but it uses UIBinder so it's easy to style with CSS. Cells can contain any widget, which makes it  highly customizable.

This code was created as a way to simplify styling for GWT CellBrowser widget in reply to a question I posted on StackOverflow:

These are two screenshots of how it may look like once styled and using custom widgets:
